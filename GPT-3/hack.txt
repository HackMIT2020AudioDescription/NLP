[[Response]]: It's a beautiful sight at the beach at East Hampton, with its long golden sands with the waves lapping on the shore. There's a group of people having a fun picnic enjoying their Saturday afternoon. The feelings and experiences felt in the beach on a cool and sunny day are always fantastic. The shimmering waves of the sea that are clear and blue mirror the rays of the sun. The refreshing breeze that emanates from the seawaters is enjoyable. The beach has many palm trees. New Yorkers from all over have come to the beach and set up tents to have a good time.
