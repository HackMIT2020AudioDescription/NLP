[[Response]]: On Saturday 4pm, it's a beautiful sight at the beach, with its long golden sands with the waves lapping on the shore. There's a group of people having a fun picnic enjoying their Saturday afternoon. There's a woman in purple laying on the beach ahead of you. At the beach, the feelings and experiences felt on a cool and sunny day are always fantastic. The shimmering waves of the sea that are clear and blue mirror the rays of the sun. The refreshing breeze that emanates from the seawaters is enjoyable. The beach has many palm trees. People from all over have come to the beach and set up blue and yellow umbrellas to enjoy some shade and have a good time.
