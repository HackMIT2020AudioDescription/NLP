[[Response]]: On Friday at 4 pm, it's a breezy, cool day in New York City. You are in a living room with a brown couch, yellow pillow, and a lamp on the wall. There's an open door with a sign saying "Bathroom". There's a picture of a person on the wall that seems to be the owner of the house. This could be your friend's house if he or she lives on 116th Street in New York.
